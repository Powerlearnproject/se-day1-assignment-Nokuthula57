*Software engineering is the systematic approach to designing, developing, testing, deploying and maintaining software. It applies engineering principles to software development to ensure that applications are reliable, efficient,scalable and maintainable. Software engineering involves various methodologies, tools and practices that help developers build high quality software products that meet user requirements.
Importance of Software engineering in the technology industry:
Ensures high quality software development
Enhance efficiency and productivity
Support scalability and maintanace
Improvs security and reliability
Drives innovation and technological advancement
Enhances user experience
Cost effective development

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
*The birth of sofware engineering (1968)
The term software engineering was first introduced at the NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968. This wad in response to the software crisis, where software projects were frequently delayed, over budget or failed entirely.
*The rise of object oriented programming(1980s -1990s)
Object orientated programming (OOP) Became widely adopted, with languages like C++, Java and python promoting modular and reusable code.
*The Agile Revolution (2001 - Present)
The Agile Manifesto, introduced in 2001, transformed software engineering by emphasizing flexibility, collaboration and iterative development.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1, PLANNING
This is the initial phase where project goals, scope,resources, risks and timelines are defined. Feasibility studies and cost benefit analyses are conducted to determine if the project is viable.
2.REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS
In this phase, stakeholders gather and document detailed requirements for the software. Functional and non-functional requirements are defined to ensure the software meets business needs.
3.DESIGN
Software architechs and designers create blueprints for the system, including database structures, user interfaces and system architecture. High level Design (HLD) documents are prepared.
4.IMPLEMENTATION (CODING)
Developers write the actual source code based on the design specifications. Programming languages, frameworks and development tools are selected for implementation.
5.TESTING
The software undergoes rigorous testing (unit testing, intergration testing, system testing and user acceptance testing) to identify and fix bugs. The goal is to ensure that the software functions correctly and meets all requirements.
6.DEPLOYMENT
Once testing is successful, the software is deployed to production, making it available to users. Deployment may be done in stages (e.g beta testing, pilot releases) to minimize risks.
7.MAINTANACE AND SUPPORT
After deploment, the software is continously monitored, updated and improved to fix issues, enhance features and adapt to changing requirements. This place ensures long term usability and performance of the software.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
*WHEN TO USE EACH METHODOLOGY
Waterfall model -Best use cases
1.Government or military projects - Requires strict documentation and compliance with regulations
2.Healthcare systems - Needs thorough planning, testing and verification before deployment
3.Construction and engineering software - Follows a fixed plan, similar to real world construction projects

Agile Model - Best Use Cases
1. Software startups and mobile apps - frequent iterations allow quick adaptation to user feedback.
2. E-commerce Platforms - continues updates and new features are necessary to meet changing customer needs.
3. Game Development - Allows teams to modify game mechanics and fix issues basedd on user feedback.

-Reduces bias and misinterpretation
-Enhances Human-AI collaboration

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
VAGUE PROMPT RXAMPLE:
''Tell me about climate change''

IMPROVED PROMPT EXAMPLE:
''Explain the impact of climate change on global sea levels over the past 50 years''

Explanation of improvemnt:
1. Clarity : The improved prompt is more specific, indicating that the focus is on the impact of climate change and global sea levels.
2. Conciseness : It avoids general terms like ''tell me about'' and directly asks for a specific type of information.
3. Targeted : By mentioning the timeframe (''past 50 years''), it ensures that the response will be focused on recent data and trends, which is crucial for more relevant and accurate information.

Why the improved prompt is more effective:
-Specificity : The original vague prompt could generate a broad response, whereas the improved prompt directs the AI to provide detailed and relevant information about the specific topic.
-Relevamce : By narrowing down the request, the improved prompt increases the likelihood of recieving focused, useful information that aligns with the users needs.
-Efficiency : It saves time and effort by reducing the need for follow-up clarifications or aaditional queries.
